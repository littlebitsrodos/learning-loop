# Daily Report - 2026-02-01

## Status
- **Date**: 2026-02-01
- **Project**: Learning Loop
- **Author**: Littlebits

## Summary
Today we fixed the distributed memory architecture - scripts now read both global and project GEMINI.md files. LaunchAgents are armed and caffeinate is running.

## Priorities

1. **[P0] Add Health Check Script**: Create `scripts/compound/health-check.sh` that verifies:
   - LaunchAgents are loaded (`launchctl print gui/$(id -u) | grep compound`)
   - Disk usage of `~/.gemini` is under 5GB
   - Recent logs show successful runs
   - Git remote is configured

2. **[P1] Commit Today's Changes**: Stage and commit all changes from today's session:
   - Updated `auto-compound.sh` (distributed memory)
   - Updated `daily-compound-review.sh` (distributed memory)
   - Updated `GEMINI.md` (session learnings)
   - New `reports/2026-02-01.md`

3. **[P2] Document the /compound Workflow**: Improve the `/compound` workflow documentation with examples and best practices.

## Notes
- Focus on verification and stability before adding new features.
- The P0 health check script will help catch issues before they cause failures.
