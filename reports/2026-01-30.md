## Status
- **Date**: 2026-01-30
- **Project**: Learning Loop
- **Author**: Littlebits

## Priorities

1. **[P0] Verify Nightly Loop Automation**: The system is new. We need to verify that `auto-compound.sh` runs correctly, reads this file, and creates a "Proof of Life" file at `proof-of-life.md` to confirm it's awake and working.
2. **[P1] Improve Log Readability**: The current logs in `Daily-compound-review.sh` and `auto-compound.sh` are plain text and hard to scan. Update the `log()` function in all scripts to support colors (Green for Info, Yellow for Warning, Red for Error) to make debugging easier.
3. **[P2] Expand /compound workflow**: Add more robust pattern matching to the regex in the learning script.
